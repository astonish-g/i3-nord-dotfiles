# My i3 Nord Dotfiles

Hello! Welcome to my dotfiles! I still have to clean this a bit and also write all the needed dependencies here!

It is running on EndeavourOS, if that info makes a change.

#### To Do!

- :red_circle: Write the needed dependencies.
- :red_circle: Find and add .oh my bash settings.
- :green_circle: Find and add Catppuccin Stylesheet files
- :red_circle: Find and add Mozilla settings

#### Screenshots

Here are some screenshots about how the system looks.
